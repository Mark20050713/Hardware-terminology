<h2>Input Device</h2>
<img src="input_device.jpg" width="300px">
<p>
In computing, an input device is an electronic device that provides your computer with data and control signals. Examples of input devices are: keyboard,  mouse, joystick, scanner, microphone, camera, etc.

<h2>Output Device</h2>
<img src="output.jpg" width="300px">
<p>An output device is any piece of computer hardware equipment which converts information into human readable form. It can be text, graphics, tactile, audio, and video</p>
	<p>Examples of Output device include: speakers, monitors

<div>
<h2>Central Processing Unit</h2>
<img src="i9.jpg" width="250px">
<p><strong>A central processing unit (CPU)</strong>, also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).</p>
<p>Note that in order for a computer to function, a CPU is mandatory, but a computer can function without a GPU.</p>
<p><strong>AMD</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong> are two of the most successful CPU manufacturers. AMD's CPU focus on <strong>multi-core performance</strong> whereas Intel's CPU focus on <strong>single-core performance</strong>. There is no right or wrong, but gamers tend to acquire Intel CPUs while IT guys tend to buy AMD CPUs.</p>

<div>
<h2>Arithemetic Logic Unit(ALU)</h2>
<img src="alu.svg" width="250px">
<p><strong>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</strong> is a part of the <strong>CPU</strong> and a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. </p>
<a href="#table"><p>Go back to table of contents</p></a>
</div>
</a>
<a name="control_unit">
<div>
<h2>Control Unit</h2>
<p><strong>The control unit(CU)</strong> is the other part of the <strong>CPU</strong>.</p>
<p>The CU directs the operation of the processor. It tells the computer's memory, arithmetic logic unit and input and output devices how to respond to the instructions that have been sent to the processor.</p>

<a name="RAM">
<div>
<h2>Random Access Unit</h2>
<img src="ram.png" width=300px>
<p>Computer random access memory (RAM) is one of the most important components in determining your system's performance. RAM gives applications a place to store and access data on a short-term basis. It stores the information your computer is actively using so that it can be accessed quickly.</p>
<p>The <strong>most important</strong> difference between random access memory and permanent storage is that, RAM needs electricity while permanent storage doesn't. In addition, the RAM in our computers is often about 16-32 GB while we may use up to 1 TB of permanent storage.</p>
<p>When we play games, there is always this loading stage when you have to wait for a minute for the game to load. The loading stage is just when the data stored in our permanent storage is transfered to our RAM. That is why RAM matters so much when we are gaming.</p>

<a name="optical_memory">
<div>
<h2>Optical Memory</h2>
<img src="optical1.jpg" width=300px>
<p>Optical storage is any storage type in which data is written and read with a laser. Common examples of optical memory include: compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), digital versatile disk read-only memory (DVD-ROM), digital versatile disk random access memory (DVD-RAM), write-once read-many (WORM) cartridges, erasable optical cartridges, and Removable Mass Storage.</p>
	<p>The Reason why many people choose optical memory is because that optical media is more durable than tape, HDDs and flash drives and less vulnerable to environmental conditions.</p>

<a name="MM">
<div>
<h2>Magnetic Memory</h2>
<img src="MM.jpg" width=300px>
<p>Magnetic storage uses different patterns of magnetisation in a magnetizable material to store data and is a form of non-volatile memory. The information is accessed using one or more read/write heads. (The little hand that moves at an incredible speed)</p>
	<p>Although SSD(Solid State Drives) are way faster than magnetic memory for they involved more advanced technology, magnetic memory is still being used today for its cheap price and the fact that it won't "wear off"</p>

<h2>Flash Memory</h2>
<img src="usb.jpg" width=300px>
<p>Flash memory, also known as flash storage, is a type of <strong>nonvolatile memory</strong> that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. Flash memory is widely used for <strong>storage and data transfer</strong> in consumer devices, enterprise systems and industrial applications.</p>
<p><strong>A flash drive</strong> is the most popular type of flash memory, and it is widely used to store data and tranfer it to another device.</p>

<div>
<h2>Logic gates</h2>
<img src="LG.jpg" width=200px>
<p>Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. It is an electronic circuit having one or more than one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic.</p>
<p>Seven basic types of logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR.</p>
